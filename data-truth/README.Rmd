## Truth data

### Cases and deaths

We evaluate forecasts of cases and deaths against [Johns Hopkins University data](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19), and we recommend using this dataset as the basis for forecasts.

-   Daily numbers of cases and deaths are available to download from [JHU](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series), or from [our repository](https://github.com/epiforecasts/covid19-forecast-hub-europe/data-truth).
-   JHU also provide [country metadata](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/blob/master/csse_covid_19_data/UID_ISO_FIPS_LookUp_Table.csv), including population counts and ISO-3 codes.

Note there are some differences between the format of the JHU data and what we require in a forecast. Please check the [Wiki](https://github.com/epiforecasts/covid19-forecast-hub-europe/wiki/Targets-and-horizons#truth-data) for more on forecast formatting.

#### Potential issues in the JHU dataset

As at `r Sys.time()`

```{r issues, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}

# Get locations
locations <- pull(readr::read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/epiforecasts/covid19-forecast-hub-europe/main/data-locations/locations_eu.csv"),
                         location)
countries <- countrycode::codelist %>%
  filter(iso2c %in% locations) %>%
  select(fips, country.name.en) %>%
  mutate(fips = str_to_lower(fips),
         country.name.en = str_to_lower(country.name.en))
country_ch <- c(countries$fips, countries$country.name.en)
country_ch <- country_ch[!country_ch %in% c("be", "no")]
country_ch <- paste0("\\b", country_ch, "\\b", collapse = "|")

# Get issues in last six weeks
issues <- gh("GET /repos/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/issues", 
             username = "CSSEGISandData",
             state = "open",
             since = Sys.Date() - (7*8), 
             sort = "updated", 
             per_page = 100)
# Get matching issues
issues <- tibble::tibble("issue" = vapply(issues, "[[", "", "title"),
                         # we cannot use vapply() for the issue body because it
                         # might be empty (i.e., NULL)
                         "message" = sapply(issues, "[[", "body"), 
                         "url" = vapply(issues, "[[", "", "html_url"),
                         "created" = as.Date(vapply(issues, "[[", "", "created_at")),
                         "updated" = as.Date(vapply(issues, "[[", "", "updated_at"))) %>%
  mutate(issue = str_to_lower(issue),
         message = str_replace_all(message, "\\r\\n", " "),
         message = str_c(str_sub(message, start = 1, end = 50), "..."),
         country = str_extract(issue, country_ch)) %>%
  filter(str_detect(issue, country_ch) &
         str_detect(url, "issues")) %>%
  select(country, created, updated, issue, message, url) %>%
  group_by(country) %>%
  arrange(desc(updated))

knitr::kable(issues, escape = FALSE)

```

### Hospitalisations

```{r hospitalisations, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
hosp_data <- readr::read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/epiforecasts/covid19-forecast-hub-europe/main/data-truth/ECDC/truth_ECDC-Incident%20Hospitalizations.csv")
hosp_locations <- sort(unique(hosp_data$location_name))
```

We gather general hospital admissions data from various sources. See separate [Hospitalisations README](https://github.com/epiforecasts/covid19-forecast-hub-europe/tree/main/code/auto_download/hospitalisations#readme).

Hospitalisation data can be difficult to produce and interpret, and is not consistent across all the countries in the ECDC Forecast Hub. To keep data and forecasts consistent, we include hospitalisations forecasts for the following locations only:

- `r hosp_locations`

![Plot of truth data from different sources for all countries covered by the forecast hub](plots/hospitalisations.svg)

The Hub validates and evaluates forecasts against the single dataset in [ECDC/truth_ECDC-Incident Hospitalizations.csv](ECDC/truth_ECDC-Incident%20Hospitalizations.csv). While we provide raw data files with multiple sources for hospitalisation data in each location, this is for reference only to cover daily as well as weekly data.

#### Additional data sources

We do not use or evaluate against these data, but the following might be useful for modelling targets:
